        <h3>All's Well That Ends Well by William Shakespear</h3>
        <h4>Act II, Scene 1. Paris, the King's Palace</h4>
        <p>
        
        <h5>KING</h5>    
        Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
        Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
        Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
        The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
        And is enough for both.
        First Lord
        'Tis our hope, sir,
        After well enter'd soldiers, to return
        And find your grace in health.
        
        <h5>KING</h5>
        No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
        Will not confess he owes the malady
        That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
        Whether I live or die, be you the sons
        Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
        Those bated that inherit but the fall
        Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
        Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
        The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
        That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
        
        <h5>Second Lord</h5>
        Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!
        
        <h5>KING</h5>
        Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
        They say, our French lack language to deny,
        If they demand: beware of being captives,
        Before you serve.
        
        <h5>Both</h5>
        Our hearts receive your warnings.
        
        <h5>KING</h5>
        Farewell. Come hither to me.
        Exit, attended

        <h5>First Lord</h5>
        O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
        
        <h5>PAROLLES</h5>
        'Tis not his fault, the spark.
        
        <h5>Second Lord</h5>
        O, 'tis brave wars!
        
        <h5>PAROLLES</h5>
        Most admirable: I have seen those wars.
